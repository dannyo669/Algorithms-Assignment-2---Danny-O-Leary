Assignment 2

The aim of this assignment was to make a movie recommender that was able to recommend movies to a user based upon their interests.
The method I used to achieve this was to to check every other users similiarity rating by multiplying their ratings together to see
how high they were, the highest would be the user who would have similar interests. 

Extras: To add a movie they simply need to enter a name of a movie with %20 acting as spaces. To achieve this I used an IMDB API to get 
all the information off of their site.
