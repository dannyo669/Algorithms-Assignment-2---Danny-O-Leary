Assignment 2

The aim of this assignment was to make a movie recommender that was able to recommend movies to a user based upon their interests.
The method I used to achieve this was to to check every other users similiarity rating by multiplying their ratings together to see
how high they were, the highest would be the user who would have similar interests.

The code is working and achieving it's goal with all the features desribed in the specification.

One problem that the code still has is that it only works on the second time it's loaded, I couldn't figure out why in time, but it has something to do with the save/load features that are implemented.

Testers aren't implemented because I ran out of time, and after trying test driven development I had to stop doing it because I couldn't figure a lot of it out.

Extras: To add a movie they simply need to enter a name of a movie with %20 acting as spaces. To achieve this I used an IMDB API to get 
all the information off of their site.
